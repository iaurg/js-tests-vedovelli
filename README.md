# Vedovelli Course Testing Javascript Applications

Tests allow you to refactor with confidence.

Everytime you make a implementation from any of the tests, you can be sure that it will work.

A test is a small piece of code that runs in the browser and checks if the code is working as expected.

Testing is a great way to make sure that your code is working as expected.

Every time you test you bring confidence to your code, making it maintanable.

### Test coverage

It's a good way to checkout all your files to see how much of your code is covered/tested.

Not focus on get 100% coverage, but focus on good and quality tests.

coverage checks:

**Function coverage** Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?

**Statement coverage** Has each statement in the program been executed?

**Branch coverage** Has each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in if and case statements) been executed? For example, given an if statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? Another way of saying this is, has every edge in the program been executed?

**Line coverage** has each executable line in the source file been executed?
